1. german-gender-game-1.html: vocab list inside html file (easy to use but not ideal for large vocal list)
2. german-gender-game-noscore.html: vocab list stored in separate json file (better for large vocab list)
3. german-gender-game.html: same as -noscore but with score tracking
4. nouns.json: vocab list in json format
<br/>
File 2,3 need to be opened in a server [python -m http.server or LiveServer in VScode (better)]
